# Message-Encode-Decode

Built a GUI interface with Python libraries such as tkinter and base64 for message encoding and decoding using common key.

### Encryption-Decryption Process
- Encoding is the process that transforms the text or information to the unrecognizable form/random and meaningless text called ciphertext
- Decoding is the process to convert the encrypted message/ciphertext into original form
